# Milestone: SERVICE

In the previous milestone, we described 3 use cases and implemented interaction with a bot by using mock data and services. In this milestone, you will be implementing the internal logic required to *actually* perform the services/tasks via the bot.

### Service

For each use case, you must implement the basic flow described by the use case. You will have a chance to continuing polishing the bot in your next milestone in order to handle edge cases and streamline interaction. It is more important that you try implementing a minimal proof of concept (that covers all use cases) rather than a perfect version of your bot (for only one use case).

As before, you will be tracking your tasks and recording a screencast that demonstrates each use case.

### Evalution

* Use Case #1 Implementation (20%)
* Use Case #2 Implementation (20%)
* Use Case #3 Implementation (20%)
* Task Tracking -- WORKSHEET.md (20%)
* Screencast (20%)

### Submission

[Submit here](https://goo.gl/forms/yEJ8snXhfk7Sepj93), a link to your repo that includes
your code, a SERVICE.md and screencast, describing how your component meets each property.

Due Thursday, Nov 10th @ midnight.
